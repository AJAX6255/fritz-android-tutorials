# Heartbeat (Android)
An example project to showcase different tflite models. Currently we have MNIST and Moble Net. For details on how to convert TF models into TFLite, check out this page https://fritzlabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/139034625/TensorFlow+Lite+Conversion

Setup:

- Download Android Studios | https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
- Open it up and download all the stuff they tell you to (Android SDK, etc)
- Go to File > Import Project and select this directory, it will automatically build the gradle file.

I'd also highly recommend downloading Genymotion for emulators (especially if you don't have an Android test phone)
- Create an account (it's free) https://www.genymotion.com/ and download the .dmg
- For it to work, you need virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Open up Genymotion and add a device by clicking the "+ Add" button. The rest is pretty straightforward.
